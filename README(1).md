# PROJECT 
Project Name : Impact of Temperature Increase and Precipitation Variations on Agricultural Production in Turkey

# OVERVIEW
This project investigates the impact of temperature increase and precipitation variations on agricultural production in Turkey. By analyzing historical data and predicting future trends, the study aims to understand how climate change affects different agricultural product groups and to make projections for the coming years, including 2030 and 2040.

# BACKGROUND
Climate change has become a critical issue globally, and its impacts are being felt in various sectors, especially agriculture. In Turkey, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns significantly affect agricultural production. This project aims to analyze these changes over the years and their effects on different types of agricultural products.

# KEY OBJECTIVES / BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
+ To analyze the historical trends in temperature and precipitation in Turkey.
+ To investigate the impact of these climate variables on different agricultural product groups.
+ To forecast the future trends of agricultural production up to 2030 and 2040.
+ To utilize artificial intelligence methods for analysis and prediction.
  
# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- How have temperature and precipitation patterns changed over the years in Turkey?
- What is the impact of these changes on different agricultural product groups?
- How can we predict future trends in agricultural production taking into account climate variables?
- Could artificial intelligence be successful in predicting these trends?
- Can artificial intelligence learn temperature, precipitation and production patterns?

# KEY STEPS
* Data collection from FAOSTAT and Meteoblue.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing.
* We divide agricultural products into four groups: animal products, fruits and vegetables, seeds and legumes, and sources of raw materials used in industrial products.
* Analyzing historical data with artificial intelligence to understand trends and relationships.
* Training artificial intelligence models to predict future trends.
* Compiling the results, making and visualizing projections for 2025, 2030 and 2040.
